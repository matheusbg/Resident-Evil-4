# Resident Evil 4
Welcome!

This project was started for learning purposes. Contribution is allowed and encouraged!

# Building
This project was successfully compiled in Visual C++ 14.0 (Visual Studio's 2015 default compiler). I did not try to compile in other compilers, so you need to do so on your own if you want it.

# Todo
Before listing, it needs to be clear that the current state of the cheat is a bare prototype. One can check the list of implemented cheats by accessing the cheat-manager file on src/cheat-manager.cpp.

It is worth noting that the cheats which involve enemies were tested only with common ones (not including special ones and bosses). If it does not work with those last two, one can easily fix it by debugging all enemy types and adding those types in the code (or wait until I can add it).

So, the planned features are:
* Aimbot (which gets closest enemy from crosshair or from player's position)
* Inventory Manager (add, remove and edit items)
* Simple player cheats (health, money and speed are examples)
* Simple weapon cheats (steady aim, infinite ammo and fast fire are examples)
* Simple DirectX cheats ("ESP" is an example)

As a side note, the informations that are needed to code most of the standard player and weapon cheats listed above are already taken, although I decided to not implement them yet.

Finally, if the companies responsable for the development of the game are feeling disrespected by those cheats, just contact me so I can remove this project.
