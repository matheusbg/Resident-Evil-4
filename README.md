# Resident Evil 4
Welcome!

This project was started for learning purposes. Contribution is allowed and encouraged!

# Building
The [DLL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic-link_library) was successfully compiled in Visual C++ 14.0 (Visual Studio's 2015 default compiler). I did not try to compile in other compilers, although it should work without problems.

# Todo
You should know that the current state of the cheat is a bare prototype. It is possible to check the list of implemented features by accessing the cheat-manager file at src/cheat-manager.cpp.

Also, the cheats which involve enemies were tested only with common ones (not including special ones and bosses). If they do not work with those last two, you can easily fix by debugging all enemy types and adding those in the code (or wait until I can add it).

So, without further ado, the planned features are:
- [ ] Aimbot
* - [ ] Target is the closest enemy from crosshair
* - [ ] Target is the closest enemy from player's position
- [ ] Inventory Manager
* - [ ] add items
* - [ ] remove items
* - [ ] edit items
- [ ] Simple player cheats
* - [ ] health
* - [ ] money
* - [ ] speed
- [ ] Simple weapon cheats
* - [ ] steady aim
* - [ ] infinite ammo
* - [ ] fast fire
- [ ] Simple DirectX cheats
* - [ ] [ESP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cheating_in_online_games#ESP)

As a side note, the informations which are needed to code most of the player and weapon cheats listed above are already taken, although I decided to not implement them yet.

Finally, if the companies responsable for the development of the game are feeling disrespected because of this project, just contact me so I can remove it.
